# The default syllable.  I have used the 'q' here to fake out a
# feature of Láadan.  The only possible vowels are 'a', 'á', 'áa',
# 'aá'.  That is, a short vowel with low or high tone, and contour
# low-to-high and high-to-low tones. If a 'q' appears in a word, I use
# filter rules below to convert it into a contour tone. I suppose I
# could have just added all possibilities to the 'V' class, but for
# this demonstration the 'q' trickery seemed better.
