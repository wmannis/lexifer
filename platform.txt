Lexifer is Python program that runs in a terminal or command shell. It
doesn't have a GUI.

First, make sure you have Python: http://python.org/


== Linux/Unix ==

Just make sure you have Unicode enabled on your terminal. For xterms,
You can CTRL-Mouse3 and select UTF-8 Fonts as well as Encoding to
enable this.  The options '-u8 -wc' to xterm should do this for you.

Fiddle with your editor's preferences to make it use Unicode.

Use the command 'lexifer' or 'lexifer.py' as you see fit.


== OSX (*cough*, excuse me, macOS) ==

Open the Terminal. In preferences, go to Profiles. With the active
profile, go to "Advanced" and make sure the Text encoding option (near
the bottom) is set to "Unicode (UTF-8)".

If you use X11, see the Linux/Unix notes above.

Use the command 'lexifer' or 'lexifer.py' as you see fit.


== Windows ==

First, you need to make your command terminal use Unicode:

 * Open cmd window
 * right-click top left corner and click "Properties"
 * click the "Font" tab
 * click NSimSun font
 * in cmd window, type "chcp 65001" to change the encoding to UTF-7/8

(Thanks to /r/Fatal_Grace for this recipe).

Use the command 'lexifer.py'.
